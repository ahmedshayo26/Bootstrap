        <h2>Poetry for the sensual soul</h2>

        <h3>Daughters of September</h3>
        <p id="parag"> i remember a time when the darkness used to haunt us.
            when ghosts would turn the whites in our eyes
            with midnight blurs,
            and everythin that lived behind our eyelids
            became risen nightmares,
            brought forth from the graves of fear 
            to terrorise us
            for forgetting their dreams.
        </p>
        <p id="parag">but now we have sunlight in our hearts,
            gathered gently into sunsets
            by our smiles.
            where rivers ran amok our faces
            life grew,
            dew rushed to settle where we felt green all over,
            and anything with wings
            came to warm themselves beneath our eyes now.
            flowers of color have began to bud in our iris,
            and you can tell from the way the butterflies move
            that they have been fantasizing about the nectar inside.
            our souls have settled like star dust in our bones.
            and these hands,
            these porcelain spaces where we offered prayer with the sorrow in our mouths
            came back with
            God's blessing,
            and we have been content ever since.

        <h3>Her Name</h3>
        <p id="parag">Her name was pronounced like the stars,
            A luminous spell
            Spoken often
            By all sorts of dark poetry,
            And one of the first commands that God gave
            The unborn night.
            A universe was born after that,
            A big bang
            That brought colour to the glass of my eyes
            Every time
            The gaze from her pupils collided with mine,
            Spectrums of red came on the shores of her lips,
            Gentle waves of a sun kiss...
            I found blue whenever she was missing in my skies
            And yellow prints the sun left on her every morning it broke dawn
            To shake her eyelids awake...
            The earth beneath her feet...
            Her smile could draw silver constellations for the
            Petal wings
            On a dozen butterflies swarming inside my stomach
            Whenever I am around her.
            And when she held my hand the first time
            It was not air that left my lungs,
            It was the colour of life
            Brushing on my tongue so 
            I painted her name
            Every time
            My heart longed to call upon her.
